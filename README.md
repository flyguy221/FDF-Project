I'm working on a project to extract annotations from Adobe FDF files and format them into RTF documents. The goal is to automatically parse and organize text annotations into categories like highlights, comments, and insights, then apply specific formatting (e.g., bolded yellow for highlights, indented blue for comments) for a structured RTF output. Challenges include refining regex patterns for accurate extraction and ensuring the RTF formatting aligns with expectations. Seeking advice on improving script accuracy and efficiency for transforming FDF annotations into neatly organized, formatted RTF documents.
